# Welcome to the Traceur FabMob e-mission Documentation!

**The documentation of Traceur Fabmob, a fork of e-mission, an open source phone-based personal mobility tracking software from UC Berkeley**. The doc is in English. (French docs are relative to end-user app manuel and evaluations and are to be found in the project site)

This repo contains all the documentation for the project, except end-user documentation (which will be on the project web site) and [almost ALL THE ISSUES](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-docs/issues/). 

[Specific issues of the Traceur FabMob project](https://github.com/fabmob/e-mission-phone-fabmob/issues) currently concern more the phone app.

There are some specialized READMEs [in the individual repositories](https://github.com/e-mission), but they are gradually being moved in here. This means that if you have any questions, you should first search here and if you don't find any [existing issues](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-docs/issues/), you should [file an issue here](https://github.com/e-mission/e-missiond-docs/issue).

## What is e-mission
E-mission is an open source mobility platform developed at the [RISE](http://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/) and [BETS](https://bets.cs.berkeley.edu/) labs in the UC Berkeley EECS Department.  
E-mission includes a mobile application for Android and iOS, with user consent, automatically collects the user's travel patterns and sends them to the server so as to derive personal mobility information and analyses; depending on user consent for sharing his/her data, the data can also be used for aggregate mobility data studies. The application is also a tool for collecting information filled in by the user (such as incidents, ground truth information about his/her trip purpose and transportation mode, or answers to questions asked in external surveys).  
The server is a python web application, the data is stored in a mongoDB database; 
the client is a Cordova application for both Android and iOS.  
The application has been initially designed to be reused in research and academic projects either for conducting and as a good learning project for CS students. It is also freely reusable for any other user cases (LINK to list to be added here).
