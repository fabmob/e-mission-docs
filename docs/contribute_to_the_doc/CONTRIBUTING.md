# Contributing to the documentation

1. [Create a fork to make your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
1. Create a branch for your change
1. Add documentation pages to `docs`, and supporting images to `assets`. You can do this directly through the github UI by creating or uploading files. Note the structure for `assets`.
1. [Link images to text](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
1. Submit a pull request
1. Please use relative paths (e.g. `../../assets/...`) instead of absolute paths (e.g. https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-docs/assets/...) while including images. This will ensure that they work even after merging and cloning.
