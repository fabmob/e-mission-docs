# Intro

Traceur Fabmob is a fork of e-mission, we enhance or add features to the software.  
The current list of enhancements planned is described in [this issue list](https://github.com/fabmob/e-mission-phone-fabmob/issues).  
When the enhancement is not too specific to FabMob, we propose them to the e-mission project as Pull Requests (from our e-mission-contrib branch).  
Among these enhancement, some are not immediate to implement so they are [tagged as "studies"](https://github.com/fabmob/e-mission-phone-fabmob/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Astudy+), 
we begin to look for a technical solution before trying to implement.

We publish here the results of the enhancement studies (one page for each study), when all goes smoothly, the page describes the solution found and the expected implementation difficulty,
and in a second step if we decide to implement, the general documentation will be updated too.
