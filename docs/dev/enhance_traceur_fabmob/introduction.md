# Contributing to Traceur FabMob code

Traceur Fabmob is a fork of e-mission, we enhance or add features to the software.  
The current list of enhancements planned is described in [this issue list](https://github.com/fabmob/e-mission-phone-fabmob/issues).  
[This report (in French)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h7PWoA6sJBYYeRoO2OgSiibv1ZJH8VLZ/view) of the developments done by Lo√Øc Mayol from June to August 2019 is particularly useful for understanding the details of the Limesurvey, internationalisation and Profile+Dashboard screens enhancements.

## GIT process
In each of our repo, there at least 2 branches, the **master branch** and the **e-mission-contrib branch** (i.e. for [e-mission-phone-fabmob](https://github.com/fabmob/e-mission-phone-fabmob/), [e-mission-server-fabmob](https://github.com/fabmob/e-mission-server-fabmob/), [e-mission-translate](https://github.com/fabmob/e-mission-translate/), [e-mission-docs](https://github.com/fabmob/e-mission-server-fabmob/)):

- the updates **specific to our FabMob app** (and thus do not concern Berkeley's e-mission) are merged on the **master** branch (e.g. for the page you are reading now which is a file in the e-mission-docs repo);  
- the corrections or enhancements **proposed as contributions** to the e-mission project should be pushed on the e-mission-contrib branch. We then make a **pull request** in the appropriate e-mission repo, which Shankari will validate and eventually update e-mission master branch with the contrib. We can then pull the updates of e-mission master back to our fabmob master branch.

## Enhancement "studies"
Among these enhancement, some are not immediate to implement, so we begin to look for a technical solution before trying to implement: they are [tagged as "studies"](https://github.com/fabmob/e-mission-phone-fabmob/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Astudy+).  

We publish here the results of the enhancement studies (one page for each study), when all goes smoothly, the page describes the solution found and the expected implementation difficulty,
and in a second step if we decide to implement, the general documentation will be updated too.
