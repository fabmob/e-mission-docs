# Create a new custom client
---

Steps to create a new custom client with a new app store entry. 

1. copy over `config.xml`
1. change the package in the `id`
1. reset the `android-versionCode`, `ios-CFBundleVersion` and `version`
1. create a new appid in apple ([https://developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com)) with the new id specified in step 2
1. the current version of the push plugin requires firebase to be configured even if you are not using i
    - create a new firebase project for the new package ([https://console.firebase.google.com)](https://console.firebase.google.com))
    - set up an iOS app with the new appid from the previous step
    - go to Settings -> Cloud Messaging
    - upload your APNs Authentication Key (create one from the apple developer account under Keys -> APNs key if you don't have one)
    - get the `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` and put them into the project root
    - Setting up Firebase for both Android and iOS is necessary, even if you only need one platform to work. 
1. *optional: iff you want to support UI channels* create a new entry for the app in the ionic console
    - copy the app id (next to the project name) into the `config.xml` under `cordova-plugin-ionic`
1. copy over `package.json` and make the same changes as `config.xml`
1. follow the full installation steps from the README ([https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone#updating-the-e-mission--plugins-or-adding-new-plugins](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone#updating-the-e-mission--plugins-or-adding-new-plugins)). 
    - Note: you should copy over your modified `config.xml` and `package.json` only after running
    ```
    $ ./bin/configure_xml_and_json.js cordovabuild
    ```
    - When Cordova properly processes your custom `config.xml`, it should output the correct package names when running `cordova prepare`: 
    ```
    Using cordova-fetch for cordova-ios@^4.5.4
    Adding ios project...
    Creating Cordova project for the iOS platform:
        Path: platforms/ios
        Package: <your.custom.full.package.name>
        Name: <your.custom.app.name>
    iOS project created with cordova-ios@4.5.5
    Discovered platform "android@^6.4.0" in config.xml or package.json. Adding it to the project
    Using cordova-fetch for cordova-android@^6.4.0
    Adding android project...
    Creating Cordova project for the Android platform:
        Path: platforms/android
        Package: <your.custom.full.package.name>
        Name: <your.custom.app.name>
        Activity: MainActivity
        Android target: android-26
    ```
1. create or copy over relevant HTML + javascript into `www`
1. create an icon under `resources/icon.png`
1. copy over the hooks (`./hooks`) and any notification icons needed (`resources/android/*`)
1. If you want to use google auth, create google auth credentials correctly for the new package name and include them into `www/json/connectionConfig.json`
1. Before you push your modifications to your own fork on GitHub, make sure you add `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` to `.gitignore`.
1. After you have finished testing, follow the standard instructions to create a production release and upload to the app/play stores. For android, you can use the `bin/sign_and_align_keys.sh` as a template. Note that this script will not work for you without modification - it has hardcoded paths. If you don't know how to edit shell scripts to match your environment, feel free to use android studio instead.
